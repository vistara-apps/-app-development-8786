- **Mindbody/Booker**: ~45% market share (larger salons and chains)
- **Vagaro**: ~25% market share (small to medium salons)
- **Square**: ~15% market share (small businesses)

## Recommendation

Based on our analysis, we recommend prioritizing integrations in the following order:

1. **Vagaro** - Best balance of API capabilities, market share, and integration simplicity
2. **Mindbody/Booker** - Largest market share, though more complex integration
3. **Phorest** - Growing platform with good API capabilities
4. **Square** - Good for smaller businesses
5. **Fresha** - Consider for future expansion

## Implementation Strategy

We recommend a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Implement Vagaro integration with core rebooking functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Add Mindbody/Booker integration
3. **Phase 3**: Implement Phorest integration
4. **Phase 4**: Add Square and Fresha based on customer demand

This approach allows us to cover approximately 70% of the market in the first two phases while building a solid foundation for additional integrations.

## Conclusion

The salon booking software market is fragmented, but by focusing on the top three platforms (Vagaro, Mindbody/Booker, and Phorest), we can address the needs of approximately 80% of our target market. Each platform has its strengths and limitations, but all provide the necessary API capabilities for our rebooking automation system.

The modular integration architecture we've designed will allow us to add support for additional platforms as needed, ensuring we can adapt to changing market conditions and customer requirements.
